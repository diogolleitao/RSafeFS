<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

RSafeFS is a software-defined file system based on SafeFS. SafeFS is a file system with a modular architecture featuring stackable layers that can be combined to construct a customized file system. The SafeFS architecture allows users to specialize their data store to their specific needs by choosing the combination of layers.
For more information regarding SafeFS, you may read this [paper](https://repositorio.inesctec.pt/server/api/core/bitstreams/85db7293-c524-40cc-8fc8-fdb0701ce377/content).

RSafeFS extends this system, by providing a full implementation in C++, and by adding the capability of remote storage. 
The prototype is implemented in the user space using the [FUSE interface](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).

The next image shows a possible architecture of two RSafeFS instances. One acts as a client and the other as a server. The client is composed of three layers, while the server is composed of two layers. The request generated by FUSE is propagated through the client layers and then transmitted to the server to be propagated through its layers. After the request has been processed by all layers, the reply is propagated in inverse order.

![Architecture](docs/images/architecture.svg)

The current implementation of RSafeFS is provided with several layers that include mechanisms based on data and metadata caching, read ahead, and remote procedure calls (RPC) to enable client-server communication.

Depending on each layer, a set of drivers may be provided to offer different approaches. For instance, different cache evictions in the caches layers, different communication protocols in the RPC layer, or different encryption mechanisms in the encryption layer.
This allows for an even more flexible and modular file system approach.

<!-- LAYERS AND DRIVERS -->
### Layers and Drivers

This are the layers available:
- `rpc_client` The RPC client layer sends requests to a server and waits for its reply, using remote procedure calls (RPC).
- `data_cache` The data caching layer aims to reduce the number of data read operations sent to the next layers. This is achieved by keeping in memory blocks of data that have been read and may be read in a near future.
- `metadata_cache` The metadata caching layer aims to reduce the number of operations on metadata that reach the storage layers by using metadata stored in memory.
- `read_ahead` The read ahead layer aims to increase read performance by reading ahead data that may be read in a near future.
- `local` The local layer sends requests to an existing file system.

Next are detailed all the parameters for the configuration file, and how the layers can be configured. Some parameters are optional. If they are not specified, default values will be used.

<!-- CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES -->
## Configuration examples 

In the folder `config_examples/` there are various `.yml` files with examples on how layers and drivers can be stacked. The layers are stacked by the order they appear in the configuration file. So, the first layer to appear in the configuration file will be the first layer in the stack.

As an example, the [sync_client.yml](config_examples/sync_client.yml) file has the following configuration:

```yml
rpc_client:
  server_address: localhost:50051
  mode: sync
metadata_cache:
  size: 16777216 # 16 MiB
  time_out: 30 # 30 seconds
  eviction_policy: rnd # random eviction
```

This is a valid client configuration. The stack is composed of two layers. The first is an RPC client layer and the other is a metadata caching layer. As explained above, the first layer (`rpc_client`) receives the server address of the server that will be used to communicate with, and a mode that indicates that the client should use the synchronous mode to send requests to the server.


The [server.yml](config_examples/server.yml) file is a valid configuration for a server.

```yml
local:
  path: /tmp # exported directory
  mode: local # passthrough
rpc_server:
  server_address: 0.0.0.0:50051
  n_queues: 1
  n_pollers_per_queue: 4
```

In this configuration, the stack is composed by one layer, named `local`. This local layer is based on the [passthrough example](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/example/passthrough.c) from the libfuse repository. This layer mirrors the existing file system, and it is implemented by just *passing through* all requests to the corresponding user-space libc functions. With this configuration, the server instance is going to export the `/tmp` directory to the clients. The `rpc_server` is configured as a layer, but actually it is not a layer. It's a like an engine that will send the requests to the next layers, like the FUSE Library does in the clients.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is how an RSafeFS instance can be deployed.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports the standard 20.

- CMake, at least version 3.22.

RSafeFS currently relies on this libraries:
- [libfuse (v2.9.9)](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse.git) or [macFUSE (v4.2.4)](https://osxfuse.github.io)
- [grpc (v1.37.0)](https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git)
- [spdlog (v1.8.0)](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog.git)
- [fmt (v8.0.1)](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git)
- [CLI11 (v2.1.2)](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11.git)
- [yaml-cpp (v0.7.0)](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git)
- [asio (v1.22.1)](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio.git)
- [googletest (v1.11.0)](https://github.com/google/googletest.git)


All, except libfuse, are installed at compile time. So, you only need to install libfuse before compiling RSafeFS.

On ubuntu, the libfuse dependency can be installed using the following command:
```bash
apt install libfuse-dev 
```

And on macOS, if [homebrew](https://brew.sh) is available, using the following command:
```bash
brew install macfuse
```

### Installation

To install the RSafeFS run the following commands:

1. Clone de repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/diogolleitao/RSafeFS.git
```

2. Building
```bash
cmake -B RSafeFS/build -S RSafeFS
cmake --build RSafeFS/build 
```

3. Testing
```bash
ctest --test-dir RSafeFS/build/tests
```

If all the steps are successful, then a binary named `rsafefs` should be produced. Next, there are some examples of how to use it.


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The `help` option shows the available options.

```
$ ./src/rsafefs --help
RSafeFS: A Modular File System for Remote Storage
Usage: ./src/rsafefs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -c,--conf TEXT:FILE REQUIRED
                              configuration file
  -m,--mount TEXT:DIR         mount point (required only on clients)
  -d,--debug                  Show debug info
```

To run a client instance, compile the code as described in the previous section and run the following command: 

```bash
./rsafefs --conf=config_examples/sync_client.yml --mount=/mnt/pont
```

Where `/mnt/point` is the mount point for your instance of RSafeFS. As referred in the help message, this option is required to run a client instance.
`config_examples/sync_client.yml` is the configuration file to be loaded.

A server can be deployed by specifying the following command:

```bash
./rsafefs --conf=config_examples/server.yml
```

As for the client, the server receives the configuration file in the `--conf` option.
